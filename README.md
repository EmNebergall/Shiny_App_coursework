## Ordination runs but plot code does not. GGPlot cannot tell that the variable selected is discrete. 

Need to add: Lots of text explanations for each element of the app. Maybe a corrplot tab with a discussion of why the correlation strengths are important 

ordination function needs to be rewritten so that NMDS can run. NMDS likely needs a very different pathway and cannot use so much of the same code as PCOA as I had hoped. 

The interface works until the point of the plot.
